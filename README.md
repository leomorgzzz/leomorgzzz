<h1 align="center"> Hi , I'm Leonardo Morales</h1>


 ***Hello, I'm Leo***

I'm a Genomic Sciences student at UNISON (University of Sonora, Mexico), passionate about data analysis, bioinformatics, and programming.

My main focus is learning how to apply programming skills to biological data, especially genomic datasets.

üñ•Ô∏è Currently learning and practicing:
- Python for data analysis and bioinformatics
- SQL for database management
- Excel for data organization and visualization
- Linux systems (huge fan of open-source)

My goal is to build strong skills that will allow me to work in research projects, internships, and part-time positions related to bioinformatics and data science.

üìÇ In this repository, I‚Äôll be uploading:
- Learning projects
- Data analysis exercises
- Personal projects as I keep developing my skills

Feel free to check my repositories and follow my progress!
